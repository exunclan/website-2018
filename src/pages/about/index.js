            small group of talented students. It is today a 50+ member
            organisation with its members standing out in various fields like
            programming, tech quizzing, web design &amp; development, digital
            imaging, 3D design &amp; animation, 2D animation and video and audio
            editing. Exun members form an elite team of computer enthusiasts of
            all ages. They have represented the school in various computer
            symposiums in India and around the world and have collectively won
